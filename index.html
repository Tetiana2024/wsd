   <h3>Kizomba</h3>
    <h4>It is a dance and musical genre that originated in Angola in 1984. Kizomba is known for having a slow, insistent, somewhat harsh yet sensuous rhythm as the result of electronic percussion. It is danced accompanied by a partner, very smoothly, slowly and sensuously, and with neither tightness nor rigidity. There are frequent simultaneous hip rotations coordinated between dance pa.</h4>
   <h3>Bachata</h3> 
    <h4>Bachata is a style of dance that originated in the Dominican Republic. It is danced widely all over the world but not identically. The basics to the dance are three-step with a Cuban hip motion, followed by a tap including a hip movement on the 4th beat. The knees should be slightly bent so the performer can sway the hips easier. The movement of the hips is very important because it is a part of the soul of the dance.</h4>
   <h3>Salsa</h3> 
    <h4>Salsa is a mixture of Cuban dances, such as mambo, pachanga, and rumba, as well as American dances such as swing and tap. Salsa has many similarities with other partner dances, the styles and skills learned in salsa can be applied to another Latin dance like Bachata.</h4>
